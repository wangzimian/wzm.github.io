In an academic context, "Principles of Object-Oriented Programming and Practical Java" can be defined as follows:
"Principles of Object-Oriented Programming" refers to the foundational concepts and methodologies in object-oriented programming (OOP) such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. These principles are fundamental to designing and implementing software systems where objects are used as the primary building blocks.
"Practical Java" denotes the application and implementation of these object-oriented principles using the Java programming language. It involves not only understanding Java syntax and features but also applying best practices in software design and development to solve real-world problems effectively. Two reference books for learning Java, [I]() and [II]().
