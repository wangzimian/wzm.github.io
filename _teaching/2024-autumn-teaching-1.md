Software engineering is a branch of engineering focused on the design, development, maintenance, and management of software systems. It combines principles from computer science, engineering, and project management to create reliable, efficient, and scalable software applications. The reference materials are [as follows](T[he reference materials are as follows](https://github.com/QSCTech/zju-icicles/blob/master/%E8%BD%AF%E4%BB%B6%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B/%E6%95%99%E6%9D%90/%E8%BD%AF%E4%BB%B6%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B%EF%BC%9A%E5%AE%9E%E8%B7%B5%E8%80%85%E7%9A%84%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95%EF%BC%88%E7%AC%AC7%E7%89%88%EF%BC%89.pdf)).
